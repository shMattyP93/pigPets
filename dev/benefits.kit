                  <h2>They are also <span>Easy-Going Pals</span></h2>
                  <p>Pigs are smart, clean, generally non-allergenic, odor-free, flea-free, charming and inexpensive to feed. Pigs are social, bonding easily with humans. They’ll readily roll over for a tummy rub, as well as snuggle with you. They don’t bark, prowl the streets or spread rabies. Compared with dog droppings, mild smelling “pig berries” are a breeze to clean up.</p>
