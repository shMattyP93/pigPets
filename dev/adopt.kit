                      I love my pig dearly, so I overlook some of the undesirable things she may do at times. I knew getting a pig as a pet would come with some issues that I wouldn't necessarily like, but I accepted that as a part of having a pig in my home. I do not regret one minute of it. I know <span>I have made good decisions for my pig and that she will never have to worry about where she will lay her head at night,</span> and ultimately all that matters to me is that my pig is safe.

                      There are times when my pig just wants to lay in my lap and be cuddled, and there are days when she does not want this, but I enjoy the days when she does. <span>The times when I take her on walks or to a store are the best.</span> My pig doesn't mind putting on a harness and it is fun to watch the neighborhood kids run out to pet her.

                      <p>Fully-grown pigs weigh between 100 and 150 pounds. Unlike the “teacup pig” myth, the smallest healthy size of a fill-grown pig is around 60 lb.</p>

                  <h3>Vietnamese Pot Bellied adult black male</h3>
                  <p><span>“Dashingly handsome, above-average smarts, with a happy disposition.”</span> If Ziggy could talk, this is how he would describe himself. In all honesty, it's pretty much the truth. Ziggy has the thickest, most beautiful coat of bristles you will ever see. Born February 2014, this stunning fella joined the sancuary in 2016. Found as a stray in northern Arizona, Ziggy is cute as a teddy bear, and confident with other pigs. Ziggy is looking for a home where he can bring one of his Sanctuary pig friends, or to join a family which already includes piggy companions.</p>
