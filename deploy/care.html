        <h2>Training your pig <span>is simple</span></h2>
        <p>Just like dogs, your pig can be walked on a leash with a harness. You should also think about getting you pig spayed or neutered, just like other dmoestic animals, it could affect their behavior if you don’t. Outdoor space is also a must for pigs, a big back yard, or grassy area to run around will help them stay in shape in keep them happy. Pigs are also very emotional animals, they feel the same emotions we do! As long as you are treating your pig well, he should maintain a happy composure. On the other hand, pigs can also feel strong feelings of sadness and anger, if prompted to of course. On the bright side, as long as you raise them well, they will continue to be happy and want to snuggle with you. Pigs are great, as long as you raise them to be!

        <h2>What to know about <span>feeding your pig</span></h2>
        <p>Feeding your pig is easy, they can eat just about anything you eat! Although they can eat anything, pigs will continuousyl eat until they die, so you need to make sure that you feed them an apropriate amount. Pigs can also be picky, they don’t like eating the same thing for every meal, change it up every once in awhile! Being that they love food so much, pigs are super easy to feed, it should’nt take much, if any, training! It’s also smart to keep them on a healthy diet, typically pig pellets, fruits, vegetables and healthy snacks are a proper practice. It’s funny that we use terms like “pig out” or “eat like a hog”, because pigs actually eat very slowly. Unlike these inaccurate quotes, pigs like to savor their food, and make it last. Pigs can also learn to follow others to food.</p>
